The survey foot is used in geodetic surveys.  As defined by the National Bureau of Standards in 1959: "Any data expressed in feet derived from and published as a result of geodetic surveys within the United States will continue to bear the following relationship as defined in 1893:  1 foot = 1200/3937 meter."
