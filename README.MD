GeographicCoordinateWS
======================

See LICENSE for this software's licensing terms.  At first glance, it resembles the BSD-3 license, but it contains a significant difference which prohibits certain use.  Read it carefully.

This is my newest project.  It's a work in progress, and is in a rather early stage.  When finished, this will be a Spring Boot application that exposes the functionality of my [GeographicCoordinate](https://github.com/kloverde/java-GeographicCoordinate) library over Web services.

A majority of the schemas are written and are being compiled with xjc.  Some POJO service classes have been completed to handle requests & responses.  Spring has not been added yet.
