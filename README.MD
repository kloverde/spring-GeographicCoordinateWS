======================

See LICENSE for this software's licensing terms.  At first glance, it resembles the BSD-3 license, but it contains a significant difference which prohibits certain use.  Read it carefully.

This project is going to provide [GeographicCoordinate](https://github.com/kloverde/java-GeographicCoordinate)'s calculation functionality over Web services using Spring Boot.  Not much is done yet - I've written some schemas and got them compiling with JAXB; more schemas are needed.
