         <xs:documentation>Lines of longitude run parallel to the Prime Meridian (perpendicular to the Equator).  Longitude denotes whether a location is east or west of the Prime Meridian.  When expressed as a floating-point number, valid longitudes sit in a range of +/- 180.0.  Positive values are east; negative values are west.  The Prime Meridian is located at longitude 0.</xs:documentation>
